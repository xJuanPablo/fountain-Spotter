## Description
This full-stacked web application is a revised version of a [previous webpage](https://github.com/xJuanPablo/Water-Environment-Tracker) I created with some friends. Fountain Spotter allows users to look up water fountains near them. This project is a revised version of a previous webpage I created with friends. The primary goal of this website is to enhance my skills and challenge myself by incorporating Python for the backend development.
